# Healthcare Metrics Tooling

This organization page has been created to develop tools that make navigating healthcare quality measures easier. 

Created and maintained by [Samia B](https://github.com/samiaab1990) 

## Tools Developed 
1. <b>AHRQ Quality Indicators Data Extraction:</b>
The AHRQ Quality Indicators (PQIs) are measures developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to evaluate clinical outcomes with inpatient hospital administrative data. Codes relevant to the indicators are extracted from pdf files from the respective modules and merged with files from The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CSSR) tools to create CSV files suitable for data analysis in R, Python or other statistical programs.
